## Airway RNA-seq Dataset
# Dataset Overview

The airway dataset is a RNA-seq experiment dataset that examines the response of human airway smooth muscle cells to glucocorticoid treatment (dexamethasone). The experiment was conducted to understand transcriptional response in asthma treatment. Source
